## My process

I build this project first and foremost with mobile first in mind. I tried to go one section by another, untill I felt satisfied with the look and feel. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanila JS



### What I learned

I learned a lot about positioning in a page, making it responsive. Also learned a few CSS tricks on the way. 

### Continued development

I would love to start using more JS in my projects, learning one project at a time.
